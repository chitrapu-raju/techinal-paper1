# Data types and Data Structures

## Introduction :
Java is statically type language where each variable and expression type we must know before hand so we must have an idea on the data types we are gonna use.  
We have two types of data types present in java  
- Primitive Data types 
- Non-Primitive Data types

Primitive data types are the most most basic and only store single values. there are 8 types of primitive data types  
- boolean  
- byte
- short  
- char
- int
- long
- float
- double  

Type casting comes in picture when we try to assign primitive data type to another datatype , there are two types of casting  

### Widening casting :
 - in this case we don't need to do anything , computer implicitly convert smaller type to larger type size.

### Narrowing casting :  
 - in this case we manually convert a larger type to smaller type size.

Non-primitive data types are such as Strings,Arrays,classes,interfaces ... etc
